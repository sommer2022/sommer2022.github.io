                        Social media platforms have evolved to play multiple roles in contemporary society -
                        such as primary sources for communication, acting as a proxy for information needs,
                        and also becoming a medium for seeking assistance.
                        One of the interesting roles social media platforms have started being used nowadays for is -
                        emergency response. During emergency events, delivering the right information in a timely manner
                        is crucial, not only for emergency response organizations but also for other social media users
                        in the vicinity. Social media platforms allow people who are actually at ground zero to express
                        their opinions and provide information about the event, thus becoming in most cases, primary
                        sources of information. However, mining social media data to provide insights that can be used
                        by emergency response comes with significant technical challenges, such as real-time information
                        extraction, information ranking, credibility, multimodality, information visualization, data
                        sampling, etc. Tackling these problems require researchers to take a truly inter-disciplinary
                        approach to enable the use-case of using social media data for emergency response holistically.
                        Through this workshop, we want to provide a \emph{cross-disciplinary forum} for researchers
                        from different fields to present and discuss research on this topic from different perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When an emergency event first occurs, getting the right information as quickly as possible is
                        critical in saving lives. When an event is ongoing, information on what is happening can be
                        critical in making decisions to keep people safe and take control of the particular situation
                        unfolding. In both cases, first responders, rescuers, peacekeepers, and others have to quickly
                        make decisions that include what resources to deploy and where. Fortunately, in most emergencies,
                        people use social media to publicly share information. Social media platforms have changed
                        emergency response, in the sense that information publicly posted on such platforms is now
                        critical, not just in understanding what's happening on the ground, but also in making critical
                        decisions on where resources are needed and how to deploy them. In many cases,
                        social media platforms have also been used to communicate with communities impacted by
                        emergencies- such communication happens between members of the community, emergency response
                        planners, non-governmental aid agencies, and government agencies.

                    <p>
                        Since the popularization of social media platforms, thousands of research papers have been
                        published on highly diverse topics of interest to different research fields- from
                        computer science to sociology. Scientists have explored networks, recommendations,
                        ranking, propagation of information, influence, and many other technical topics. In spite of
                        its importance, the research community, however, in our view, has not done as much work in
                        relation to how social media data can be used for emergency response. There are significant
                        efforts at various universities working on these topics, but there are few venues to gather
                        scientists from different disciplines together to present and discuss progress and challenges
                        in leveraging social media data for emergency response. The goal of this workshop is to provide
                        a stage for scientists working on different fields relevant to leveraging social media data
                        for emergency response. While the focus of the workshop will be on emergency response,
                        the actual sub-topics will be broad, allowing researchers to present state-of-the-art
                        results that might be relevant to this important topic, while providing the space for
                        presenting new, innovative ideas and perspectives from researchers in technical and
                        non-technical fields.
